## How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because I need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/levabd/digit-symbol-recogniser/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/levabd/digit-symbol-recogniser/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
